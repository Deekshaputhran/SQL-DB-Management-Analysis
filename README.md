Pharmacogeninsight is a comprehensive database project aimed at optimizing drug prescriptions through genetic information.
By integrating patient data, genetic variants, drug information, and treatment outcomes, 
this project seeks to enhance personalized treatment plans and improve patient care. 
The primary goal is to reduce adverse drug reactions and tailor therapies to individual genetic profiles.

Key Features
Personalized Medicine: Pharmacogeninsight uses genetic data to optimize drug prescriptions, improving drug efficacy and safety.
Data Integration: The database links patients, genetic variants, drugs, and treatment responses for holistic analysis.
Improved Patient Outcomes: Through the identification of genetic factors influencing drug metabolism, the project helps clinicians reduce adverse reactions and enhance therapeutic effectiveness.

Database Structure
Pharmacogeninsight is built using a relational database model, with several interconnected tables:
Patients: Contains information about patients, including demographic data and medical history.
GeneticVariants: Stores details about specific genetic variants that may affect drug metabolism or treatment response.
Drugs: A list of drugs, including their relevant properties and interactions.
PatientVariants: Links patients to their specific genetic variants.
Treatments: Records details about treatments prescribed to patients, including drug dosages and duration.
Responses: Tracks patient responses to treatments, such as therapeutic success or adverse drug reactions.

Use Cases
Clinicians: Can use the database to identify optimal treatments based on a patientâ€™s genetic profile.
Researchers: Can explore the relationships between genetic variants and drug efficacy to contribute to the field of pharmacogenomics.
Healthcare Systems: Can implement Pharmacogeninsight to enhance decision-making processes and reduce costs associated with ineffective treatments or adverse drug reactions.

Usage
You can query the database to:
Retrieve a patient's genetic profile and suggest drug alternatives based on genetic variants.
Analyze the effectiveness of drugs for patients with certain genetic traits.
Track patient responses to prescribed treatments and adjust plans accordingly.
